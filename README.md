## Overview  
This repository outlines the process for gathering frequently requested data through the most efficient methods we can, and building on this library over time. In the APIs folder there is code for pulling data from various public APIs and formatting it to be joined as a file for one year. There is a notebook for each data series (and year, if needed) to ensure that there is no variable confusion, for example, the 2016-2020 ACS 5 Year Estimates. This information is saved and ready to be filtered for various comprehensive plans and data requests.
