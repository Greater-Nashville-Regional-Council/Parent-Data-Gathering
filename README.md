## Overview  
This repository outlines the process for gathering frequently requested data through the most efficient methods we can, and building on this library over time. In the APIs folder there is code for pulling data from various public APIs and formatting it to be joined as a file for one year. There is a notebook for each data series (and year, if needed) to ensure that there is no variable confusion, for example, the 2016-2020 ACS 5 Year Estimates. This information is saved and ready to be filtered for various comprehensive plans and data requests.  

## APIs  
+ Census Bureau  
+ Census TIGER Files
+ Center for Disease Control  
+ Bureau of Economic Analysis  
+ Bureau of Labor Statistics  

## Downloaded Data Sources  
+ Woods and Poole Projections  
+ Department of Housing and Urban Development Residential Permits  
+ TN State Data Center  
+ Historical Census Population  

## Formatting, Calculations, Exports and Data Storage  
As this process is developed as an outline for all data pulls and formatting, exports from API calls and download formatting are standardized and stored to be pulled into other projects and filtered appropriately. Frequently used formatting/calculations from raw data are performed for all geographies in the GNRC region and many adjacent geographies simultaneously. The raw data is catalogued, but dropped at this point. For every data source and year, requested data points are accumulated here over time. All files are available to be catalogued, or deleted and reproduced using the same process when needed for other projects for storage efficiency.
